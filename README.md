# Snowboaring Website for SDEV 143 Website Development
## Overview
This was my final project for a website that I was tasked with making. I decided to go with an e-commerce snowboarding website.

## DISCLAIMERS
The site doesn't actually sell anything. It's merely a showcase and nothing more. The brands and brand names used in the website are for demonstration purposes only and do not represent any real affiliation or partnership with these brands. All product images, descriptions, and prices are fictional and are used to provide a realistic user experience for educational purposes.
